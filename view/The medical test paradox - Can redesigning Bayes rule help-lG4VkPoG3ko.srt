1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,740
particular test result is correct you can

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,390
still land on a very low number

3
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,110
arbitrarily low in fact in short an

4
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,900
accurate test is not necessarily a very

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,800
predictive test

6
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,040
don't people think about math and formulas

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,390
they don't often think of it as

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,550
a design process i mean maybe in

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,080
the case of notation it's easy to

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,480
see the different choices are possible but

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,950
when it comes to the structure of

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,020
the formulas themselves and how we use

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,390
them that's something that people typically view

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,660
as fixed in this video you and

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,130
i will dig into this paradox

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,690
but instead of using it to talk

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,640
about the usual version of base rule

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,860
i'd like to motivate an alternate version

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,660
an alternate design choice

20
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:03,089
what's up on the screen now is

21
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,920
a little bit abstract which makes it

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,780
difficult to justify that there really is

23
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,000
a substantive difference here especially when i

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,370
haven't explained either one yet to see

25
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,630
what i'm talking about though we should

26
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,129
really start by spending some time a

27
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:16,260
little more concretely and just laying out

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,210
what exactly this paradox is

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,279
picture a thousand women and suppose that

30
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:28,020
one percent of them have breast cancer

31
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,060
and let's say they all undergo a

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,604
certain breast cancer screening and nine of

33
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:35,190
those with cancer correctly get positive results

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,710
and there's one false negative and then

35
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,509
suppose that among the remainder without

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,450
cancer eighty nine get false positives and

37
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,460
nine hundred and one correctly get negative

38
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,920
results so if all you know about

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,330
a woman is that she does the

40
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,190
screening and she gets a positive result

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,020
you don't have information about symptoms or

42
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,210
anything like that you know that she's

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,040
either one of these nine true positives

44
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,720
or one of these eighty nine false

45
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,380
positives

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,199
so the probability that she's in the

47
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:03,900
cancer group given the test result is

48
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,270
nine divided by nine plus eighty nine

49
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,250
which is approximately one in eleven

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,678
in medical parlance you would call this

51
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,050
the positive predictive value of the test

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,180
or p p v the number of

53
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,400
true positives divided by the total number

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,530
of positive test results you can see

55
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,030
where the name comes from to what

56
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,910
extent does a positive test result actually

57
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,560
predicts that you have the disease

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,860
now hopefully as i presented it this

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,600
way where we're thinking concretely about a

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,090
sample population all of this makes perfect

61
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,979
sense but where it comes across as

62
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:37,140
counter intuitive as if you just look

63
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,120
at the accuracy of the day present

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,832
it to people as a statistic and

65
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:42,420
then ask them to make judgments about

66
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,000
their test results test accuracy is not

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,350
actually one number but two

68
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,746
first you ask how often does it

69
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:51,270
test correct on those with the disease

70
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,580
this is known as the test sensitivity

71
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,680
as in how sensitive is it to

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,350
detecting the presence of the disease in

73
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,359
our example test sensitivity is nine and

74
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:02,790
ten or ninety percent and another way

75
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,080
to say the same fact would be

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,610
to say the false negative rate is

77
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,270
ten percent

78
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,270
and then a separate not necessarily related

79
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,220
number is how often it's correct for

80
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,410
those without the disease which is known

81
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,140
as the test specificity as in our

82
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:19,140
positive results caused specifically by the disease

83
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,690
or are their confounding triggers giving false

84
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,020
positives in our example the specificity is

85
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,060
about ninety one percent or

86
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,284
or another way to say the same

87
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,700
fact would be to say the false

88
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,370
positive rate is nine percent so the

89
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,680
paradox here is that in one sense

90
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,838
the test is over ninety percent accurate

91
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,090
it gives correct results to over ninety

92
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,470
percent of the patients who take it

93
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,870
and yet if you learn that someone

94
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,850
gets a positive result without any added

95
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,980
information is actually only a one in

96
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,220
the leg

97
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:49,200
and chance that that particular result is

98
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,620
accurate

99
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,690
this is a bit of a problem

100
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,302
because of all of the places for

101
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,589
match to be counter intuitive medical tests

102
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,910
or one area where it matters a

103
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,829
lot in two thousand and six and

104
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,754
two thousand and seven the psychologist scared

105
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:01,770
to get your ends are gave a

106
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,800
series of statistics seminars to practicing gynecologist

107
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,840
and he opened with the following example

108
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,300
a fifty year old woman no symptoms

109
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,320
participates in

110
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,260
the routine demography screening she tests positive

111
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,150
is alarmed and wants to know from

112
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,649
you whether she has breast cancer for

113
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,110
certain or what her chances are apart

114
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,790
from the screening result you know nothing

115
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,310
else about this woman in that seminar

116
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,600
the doctors were then told that the

117
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,280
prevalence of breast cancer for women of

118
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,470
this age is about one percent and

119
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,480
then to suppose that the test sensitivity

120
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,848
is ninety percent and that it's specificity

121
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,190
was ninety one percent you might notice

122
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,657
these are exactly the same numbers from

123
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:37,770
the example that you and i just

124
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,090
looked at this is where i got

125
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,520
them so having already thought it through

126
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,990
you and i know the answer it's

127
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,980
about one and eleven

128
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,380
however the doctors in the session were

129
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,119
not primed with his ingestion to picture

130
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,710
a concrete sample of it that was

131
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,180
in individuals' the way that you and

132
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,950
i had all they saw were these

133
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,470
numbers they were then asked how many

134
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,080
women who test positive actually have breast

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,059
cancer what is the best answer and

136
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,890
they were presented with these four choices

137
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,440
in one of the sessions over half

138
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:04,710
the dock

139
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,720
doctors president said that the correct answer

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,940
was nine and ten which is way

141
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,280
off only a fifth of them gave

142
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,170
the correct answer which is worse than

143
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,369
what it would have been if everybody

144
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,480
had randomly guessed

145
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,910
it might seem a little extreme to

146
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,980
be calling this a paradox i mean

147
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,870
it's just a fact it's not something

148
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,350
intrinsically self contradictory but as these seminars

149
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,780
with bigger and to show people including

150
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,780
doctors definitely find it counterintuitive that a

151
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,850
test with high accuracy can give you

152
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,350
such a low predictive value

153
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,830
we might call this a vertical paradox

154
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,780
which refers to facts that are proven

155
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,790
to be true but which nevertheless can

156
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,800
feel false when faced a certain way

157
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,630
it's sort of the softest form of

158
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,910
a paradox saying more about human psychology

159
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,880
than about logic the question is how

160
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,930
we can combat this

161
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,200
where we going with this by the

162
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,490
way is it i want you to

163
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,750
be able to look at numbers like

164
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,940
this and quickly estimate in your head

165
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,470
that it means to predict the value

166
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,510
of a positive test should be around

167
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,670
one in eleven or if i change

168
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,170
things and asked what if it was

169
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,090
ten percent of the population who had

170
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,830
breast cancer you should be able to

171
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,660
quickly turn around and say that the

172
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,170
final in

173
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,910
after would be a little over fifty

174
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,460
percent or if i said imagine a

175
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,530
really low prevalence something like zero point

176
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,110
one percent of patients having cancer you

177
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,209
should again quickly estimate that the predictive

178
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,680
value of the test is around one

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,239
in a hundred that one in a

180
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:29,190
hundred of those with positive test results

181
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,690
in that case would have cancer

182
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,700
or let's say we go back to

183
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,350
the one percent prevalence but i make

184
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,790
the test more accurate i tell you

185
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,740
to imagine the specificity is ninety nine

186
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,869
percent there you should be able to

187
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,060
relatively quickly estimate that the answer is

188
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,548
a little less than fifty percent the

189
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:45,810
hope is that you're doing all of

190
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,790
this with minimal calculations in your head

191
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,610
for the goals of quick calculations might

192
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,080
feel very different from the goals of

193
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,289
addressing whatever misconception underlies this paradox but

194
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,969
they actually go hand in hand let

195
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:58,560
me show you what i mean on

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,050
the state of addressing misconceptions what would

197
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,190
you tell to the people in that

198
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,709
seminar who answered nine and ten what

199
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:07,080
fundamental misconception are they reviewing

200
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,540
what i might tell them is that

201
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,830
in much the same way that you

202
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,480
shouldn't think of tests as telling you

203
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,640
deterministic early whether you have a disease

204
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,290
you shouldn't even think of them as

205
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,119
telling you your chances of having a

206
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,420
disease instead the healthy view of what

207
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,940
test do is it they update your

208
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,600
chances

209
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,960
in our example before taking the test

210
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,000
the patient's chances of having cancer were

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,680
one in a hundred in basie in

212
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,840
terms we call this the prior probability

213
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,970
the effect of this test was to

214
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,340
update that prior almost an order of

215
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,500
magnitude up to around one and eleven

216
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,960
the accuracy of a test is telling

217
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,940
us about the strength of this updating

218
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,830
it's not telling us the final answer

219
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,719
what does this have to do with

220
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,400
quick approximations well

221
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,099
a key number for those approximations is

222
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,290
something called the base factor in the

223
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,480
very act of defining this number serves

224
00:07:57,494 --> 00:08:00,150
to reinforce the central lesson about reclaiming

225
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,460
what it is the tests do you

226
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,540
think one of the things that makes

227
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,910
tested his dick's so very confusing is

228
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,409
it there are at least four numbers

229
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,450
that you'll hear associated with them for

230
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,559
those with the disease there's

231
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,628
insensitivity in the false negative rate and

232
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:14,460
then for those without there's the specificity

233
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,200
in the false positive rate and none

234
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,730
of these numbers actually tell you the

235
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,640
thing you want to know luckily if

236
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,110
you want to interpret a positive test

237
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,090
result you can pull out just one

238
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,650
number to focus on from all this

239
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,930
take the sensitivity divided by the false

240
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,420
positive rate in other words how much

241
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:30,720
more

242
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,950
we're likely are you to see the

243
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,920
positive test result with cancer versus without

244
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,200
in our example this number is ten

245
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,290
this is the base factor also sometimes

246
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,820
called the likelihood ratio

247
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,588
a very handy rule of thumb is

248
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:46,380
to update a small pryor or at

249
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,600
least to approximate the answer you simply

250
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,848
multiply it by the base factor so

251
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,140
in our example where the prior was

252
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,000
one in a hundred you would estimate

253
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,260
that the final answer should be around

254
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,000
one in ten which is in fact

255
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,850
slightly above the true correct answer so

256
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,350
based on this rule of thumb if

257
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,060
i asked you what would happen if

258
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,920
the prior from her example was instead

259
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,200
one in a thousand you could quickly

260
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,580
estimate that the effect of the test

261
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,380
should be to update those chances to

262
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,540
around one in a hundred and in

263
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,190
fact take a moment to check yourself

264
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,860
by thinking through a sample population in

265
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,720
this case you might picture ten thousand

266
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,310
patients were only ten of them really

267
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,970
have cancer

268
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,520
and then based on that ninety percent

269
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,980
sensitivity we would expect nine of those

270
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,990
cancer cases to give true positives

271
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,900
and on the other side and ninety

272
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,510
one percent specificity means that nine percent

273
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,310
of those without cancer are getting false

274
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,920
positives so we'd expect nine percent of

275
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,750
the remaining patients which is around nine

276
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,050
hundred to get false positive results here

277
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,480
with such a low prevalence the false

278
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,910
positives really do dominate the true positives

279
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,230
so the probability that

280
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,510
a randomly chosen positive case from this

281
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,510
population actually has cancer is only around

282
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,340
one percent just like the rule of

283
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,120
thumb predicted

284
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,750
now this rule of thumb clearly cannot

285
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,120
work for hire priors for example they

286
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:04,770
would predict that a prior of ten

287
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,630
percent gets updated all the way to

288
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,060
one hundred percent certainty that can't be

289
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,010
right in fact take a moment to

290
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,660
think through what the answer should be

291
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,390
again using a sample population maybe this

292
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,830
time we picture ten out of a

293
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,000
hundred and having cancer

294
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:20,875
based on the ninety percent sensitivity of

295
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,855
the test we'd expect nine of those

296
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,985
true cancer cases to get positive results

297
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,025
but what about the false positive how

298
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,165
many do we expect there

299
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:31,915
about nine percent of the remaining ninety

300
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,955
about eight so

301
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:36,503
upon seeing a positive test result it

302
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:37,975
tells you that you're either one of

303
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:40,045
these nine true positives or one of

304
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:41,245
the eight false positive

305
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:43,375
this means the chances are a little

306
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,655
over fifty percent roughly nine out of

307
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:48,655
seventeen or fifty three percent at this

308
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,607
point having dared to dream debate and

309
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:52,735
updating could look as simple as multiplication

310
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:54,355
you might tear down your hopes and

311
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:56,755
pragmatically acknowledge sometimes life is just more

312
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:57,685
complicated than that

313
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:02,365
except it's not this rule of thumb

314
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:04,795
turns into a precise mathematical fact as

315
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:06,175
long as we shift away from talking

316
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:09,205
about probabilities to instead talking about audits

317
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:11,695
if you've ever heard someone talk about

318
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:13,315
the chances of an event being one

319
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:14,905
to one or two to one things

320
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:17,125
like that you already know about odds

321
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:19,825
with probability were taking the ratio of

322
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:21,595
the number of positive cases out of

323
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,175
all possible cases things like one in

324
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:26,544
five or one in with odds what

325
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:27,775
you do is take the ratio of

326
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:30,415
all positive cases to all negative cases

327
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:33,085
you commonly see odds written with a

328
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:35,334
colon to emphasize the distinction but it's

329
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:38,034
still just a fraction a number to

330
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:40,165
an event with a fifty percent probability

331
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:41,875
would be described as having one to

332
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,665
one odds are ten percent probability is

333
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:46,285
the same as one to nine odds

334
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,475
an eighty percent probability is the same

335
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,125
as four to one odds you get

336
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:50,515
the point

337
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,485
it's the same information it still describes

338
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:55,465
the chances of a random event but

339
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,265
it's presented a little differently like a

340
00:11:57,265 --> 00:12:00,955
different unit system probabilities are constrained between

341
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:03,115
zero and one with even chances sitting

342
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:05,875
at zero point five but odds range

343
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,945
from zero up to infinity with even

344
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:09,715
chance is sitting at the number one

345
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:14,305
the beauty here is it a completely

346
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:16,494
accurate not even approximating things way to

347
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:18,976
frame basic rule is to say expressed

348
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:21,025
your prior using odds and then just

349
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:23,725
multiply by the base sector think about

350
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:25,375
what the prior odds are really saying

351
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,385
it's the number of people with cancer

352
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:28,945
divided by the number without it

353
00:12:29,845 --> 00:12:31,104
let's just write that down to the

354
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:32,455
normal fraction for a moment so we

355
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:34,735
can multiply it when you filter down

356
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,804
just to those with positive test results

357
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:38,815
the number of people with cancer gets

358
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:41,185
scaled down scaled down by the probability

359
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:43,435
of seeing a positive test result given

360
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:45,895
that someone has cancer and then similarly

361
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,444
the number of people without cancer also

362
00:12:48,445 --> 00:12:49,615
get scaled down this

363
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:51,415
time by the probability of seeing a

364
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:53,485
positive test result but in that case

365
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:56,095
so the ratio between these two counts

366
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:58,345
the new odds upon seeing the test

367
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:01,164
looks just like the prior odds except

368
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:03,535
multiplied by this term here which is

369
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:04,855
exactly the base factor

370
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,505
look back at our example where the

371
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:11,485
base factor was ten and as a

372
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:13,495
reminder this came from the ninety percent

373
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:15,865
sensitivity divided by the nine percent false

374
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:18,025
positive rate how much more likely are

375
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,435
you to see a positive result with

376
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:22,495
cancer versus without if the prayer is

377
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:24,835
one percent expressed his odds this looks

378
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:26,095
like one to ninety nine

379
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:28,795
so by our rule this gets updated

380
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:30,205
to tend to ninety nine

381
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:32,515
which if you weren't you could convert

382
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:33,955
back to a probability it would be

383
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:35,845
ten divided by ten plus ninety nine

384
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:37,375
were about one in eleven

385
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:40,255
if instead the prior was ten percent

386
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:41,941
which was the example that tripped up

387
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:44,155
our rule of thumb earlier expressed his

388
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:46,345
odds this looks like one to nine

389
00:13:47,065 --> 00:13:48,924
by her simple rule this get updated

390
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:50,575
to tend to nine which you can

391
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:52,915
already read off pretty intuitively it's a

392
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,925
little above even chances a little above

393
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:57,415
one to one if you prefer you

394
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:58,075
can convert it back

395
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,665
to a probability you would write it

396
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:01,855
as ten out of nineteen or about

397
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:04,405
fifty three percent and indeed that is

398
00:14:04,405 --> 00:14:05,875
what we already found by thinking things

399
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,665
through with a sample population let's say

400
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:09,715
we go back to the one percent

401
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,305
prevalence but i make the tests more

402
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:12,895
accurate now what if i told you

403
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,485
to imagine that the false positive rate

404
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:16,225
was only one person instead of nine

405
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:18,235
percent but that would mean is

406
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:20,125
that are based factor is ninety instead

407
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,805
of ten the test is doing more

408
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:23,844
work for us in this case with

409
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:25,855
the more accurate test it gets updated

410
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:28,075
to ninety to ninety nine which is

411
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,665
a little less than even chance is

412
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:32,215
something a little under fifty percent to

413
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:33,685
be more precise you could make the

414
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,905
conversion back to probability and work out

415
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:37,915
that it's around forty eight percent but

416
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:38,376
honestly

417
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:39,775
you're just going for a gut feel

418
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:41,545
it's fine to stick with the odds

419
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:44,125
do you see what i mean about

420
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,014
how just defining this number helps to

421
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,074
combat potential misconceptions for anybody who's a

422
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:51,865
little hasty in connecting test accuracy directly

423
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,635
to your probability of having a disease

424
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:56,305
it's worth emphasizing that you could administer

425
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:58,615
the same test with the same accuracy

426
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:00,775
to multiple different patients who all get

427
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,755
the same exact result but if

428
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:04,705
they are coming from different contact that

429
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:07,765
result could mean wildly different things however

430
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,926
the one thing that does stay constant

431
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:11,965
in every case is the factor by

432
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:14,665
which each patient prior odds get updated

433
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:17,365
and by the way this whole time

434
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:18,775
we've been using the prevalence of the

435
00:15:18,775 --> 00:15:20,755
disease which is the proportion of people

436
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,555
in a population who have it as

437
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:25,225
a substitute for the prior the probability

438
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:26,484
of having it before you see a

439
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:29,545
test however that's not necessarily the case

440
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,705
if there were other unknown factors things

441
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:33,324
like symptoms or in the case of

442
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,935
a contagious disease things like known contacts

443
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,122
those also factor into the prior and

444
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:39,985
they could potentially make a huge difference

445
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:42,385
as another side note so far we've

446
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:44,965
only talked about positive test results but

447
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:46,405
way more often you would be seeing

448
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:48,745
a negative test result the logic there

449
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:50,455
is completely the same but the biggest

450
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:51,804
factor that you compute is going to

451
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:53,725
look different instead you look at the

452
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:56,095
probability of seeing this negative test result

453
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,705
with the disease versus without the disease

454
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:00,774
so in our cancer example this would

455
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:02,605
have been the ten percent false negative

456
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:04,765
rate divided by the ninety one percent

457
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:07,885
specificity or about one in nine in

458
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,015
other words seeing a negative test result

459
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,565
in that example would reduce your prior

460
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:14,575
odds by about an order of magnitude

461
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:16,944
when you write it all out as

462
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:18,865
a formula here's how it looks it

463
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:20,635
says your odds of having a disease

464
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:23,545
given a test result equals your odds

465
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:26,215
before taking the test prior odds times

466
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:28,765
the biggest factor that let's contrast this

467
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,294
with the usual way that pays well

468
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:31,735
as britain which is a bit more

469
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:33,895
complicated in case you haven't seen it

470
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:35,635
before it's essentially just what we were

471
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:35,785
doing

472
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:37,855
what sampled populations but you wrap it

473
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:40,585
all up symbolically remember how every time

474
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:42,115
we were counting the number of true

475
00:16:42,115 --> 00:16:44,425
positives and then dividing it by some

476
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:45,805
of the true positives and the false

477
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,805
positives we do just that except instead

478
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:50,844
of talking about absolute amounts we talk

479
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:53,125
of each term as a proportion so

480
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:54,835
the proportion of true positives in the

481
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:55,555
population

482
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:57,655
i'm from the prior probability of having

483
00:16:57,655 --> 00:17:00,145
the disease multiplied by the probability of

484
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,825
seeing a positive test result in that

485
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:04,283
case then we copy that term down

486
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,355
again into the denominator and then the

487
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:08,725
proportion of false positives comes from the

488
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:11,155
prior probability of not having the disease

489
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:13,255
times the probability of a positive test

490
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,625
in that case if you weren't you

491
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,104
could also write

492
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:17,981
this down with words instead of symbols

493
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:20,155
terms like sensitivity and false positive rate

494
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:22,255
are more comfortable and this is one

495
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:23,665
of those formulas where once you say

496
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:24,685
it out loud it seems like a

497
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:26,365
bit much but it really is no

498
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:27,564
different from what we were doing was

499
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:29,965
sampled populations if you wanted to make

500
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,495
the whole thing look simpler you often

501
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:34,015
see this entire denominator written just as

502
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,995
the probability of seeing a positive test

503
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:36,265
result

504
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:39,115
overall while that does make for a

505
00:17:39,115 --> 00:17:41,575
really elegant little expression if you intend

506
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:43,255
to use this for calculations it's a

507
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:45,985
little disingenuous because in practice every single

508
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:46,975
time you do this you need to

509
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:49,195
break down that denominator into two separate

510
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:52,134
parts breaking down the cases so taking

511
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:54,325
this more honest representation of it let's

512
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:56,155
compare two versions of base rule

513
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:58,165
and again maybe it looks nicer if

514
00:17:58,165 --> 00:17:59,695
we use the word sensitivity and false

515
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:01,615
positive rate if nothing else it helps

516
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,474
emphasize which parts of the formula are

517
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:05,785
coming from statistics about the test accuracy

518
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:07,735
i mean this actually emphasizes one thing

519
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:08,995
i really like about the framing with

520
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:10,795
odds and a base factor which is

521
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:12,624
that it cleanly factors out the parts

522
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,765
that have to do with the prior

523
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:14,935
and the parts that have to do

524
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:15,925
with the test accuracy

525
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,685
but over in the usual formula all

526
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:20,965
of those are very intermingled together and

527
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,824
this is a very practical benefit it's

528
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:24,055
really nice if you want to swap

529
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:25,884
out different priors and easily see their

530
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,535
effect this is what we were doing

531
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:29,605
earlier but with the other formula to

532
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:31,225
do that you have to re compute

533
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:33,355
everything each time you can't leverage a

534
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:35,365
pre computed based factor the same way

535
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:36,718
the odds

536
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,215
aiming also makes things really nice if

537
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:39,805
you want to do multiple different busy

538
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:41,695
and updates based on multiple pieces of

539
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,645
evidence for example let's say you took

540
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:45,865
not one test but to or you

541
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:46,765
want it to think about how the

542
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:49,225
presence of symptoms plays into it for

543
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:50,875
each piece of new evidence you see

544
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:52,705
you always ask the question how much

545
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:53,995
more likely would you be to see

546
00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:56,185
that with the disease versus without the

547
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:56,725
disease

548
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:58,855
each answer to that question gives you

549
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:00,565
a new base factor in new thing

550
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:02,095
that you multiply by your odds

551
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:05,605
beyond just making calculations easier there's something

552
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:07,135
i really like about attaching a number

553
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,115
to test accuracy that doesn't even look

554
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,305
like a probability mean if you hear

555
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:12,925
that a test has for example eight

556
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:15,295
nine percent false positive rate that's just

557
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:18,205
such a disastrously ambiguous phrase it's so

558
00:19:18,205 --> 00:19:19,824
easy to misinterpret it to mean there's

559
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,505
a nine percent chance that your positive

560
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:23,365
test result is false but

561
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:24,865
imagine if instead the number that we

562
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:26,811
heard tacked on to test result was

563
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:28,495
that the base factor for a positive

564
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:31,465
test result is safe ten there's no

565
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:33,325
room to confuse that for your probability

566
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:35,575
of having a disease the entire framing

567
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,408
of what a base factor is is

568
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:38,695
it it's something that acts on their

569
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,035
prior it forces your hand to acknowledge

570
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:43,135
the prior is something that's separate entirely

571
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:43,525
and how

572
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,565
highly necessary to drawing any conclusion

573
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:49,795
all that said the usual formulas definitely

574
00:19:49,795 --> 00:19:51,627
not without it's merits if you view

575
00:19:51,627 --> 00:19:53,005
it not simply as something to plug

576
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:55,675
numbers into but as an encapsulation of

577
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:57,385
the sample population idea that we've been

578
00:19:57,385 --> 00:19:59,935
using throughout you could very easily argue

579
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,465
that that's actually much better for your

580
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:03,715
intuition after all it's what we were

581
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:05,425
routinely falling back on in order to

582
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:06,175
check ourselves

583
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,125
at the base vector computation even made

584
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,175
sense in the first place

585
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,795
like any design decision there is no

586
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,955
clear cut objective best here but it's

587
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:17,845
almost certainly the case that giving serious

588
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:20,095
consideration to that question will lead you

589
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,645
to a better understanding of peaceful

590
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,290
oh

591
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,770
also since we're on the topic of

592
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,809
kind of paradoxical things a friend of

593
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,460
mine matt cooke recently wrote a book

594
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,130
all about paradoxes i actually contributed a

595
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,600
small chapter to it with thoughts on

596
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,340
the question of whether method invented or

597
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,050
discovered in the book as a whole

598
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,700
is this really nice connection of thought

599
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,464
provoking paradoxical things brings

600
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:48,960
from philosophy to math and physics you

601
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,400
can of course find all the details

602
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,270
