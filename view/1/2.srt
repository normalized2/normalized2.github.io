1
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:20,160
of that there should be prosecution against

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,599
him but i don't think anybody could

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,240
look and say at peach of this

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,920
president is is the thing that's going

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,930
to help unite and and bring our

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,920
country together

7
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,008
today it has joined over and patient

8
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:33,150
let's talk about an hour to members

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,310
of congress congress woman had her cost

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,719
you a court and a democrat from

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,940
new york congressman adam ten singer republican

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,565
from illinois and cars on court as

13
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:43,110
when they began a win here so

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,269
i know you're a supporter of impeachment

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,710
the speaker has not yet decided whether

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,389
she's going to schedule it should she

17
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:49,830
schedule it will it pass

18
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,937
well you know i absolutely believe that

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,250
impeachments should be scheduled for several rings

20
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,070
several reasons one of course our main

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,530
priority is to ensure the removal of

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,450
donald trump as president of the united

23
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,760
states every minute and every hour that

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,130
he is an office represents a clear

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,350
and present danger not just to

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,450
at the united states congress but frankly

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,920
to the country but in addition to

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,030
removal were also talking about complete barring

29
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:20,040
of the president or rather of donald

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,980
trump from running for office ever again

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,410
and in addition to that the potential

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,430
ability to prevent pardoning himself from those

33
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:30,510
charges that's neat

34
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,660
with impeached at four and you know

35
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:35,850
the several republican members of congress who

36
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,698
oppose raising objections to this sort of

37
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:39,900
find the electoral college would have written

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,330
a letter to president elect biden opposing

39
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,890
impeachment here's what the letter says it

40
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,539
says in the spirit of healing and

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,609
fidelity or constitution we ask you falling

42
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,190
request speaker nancy pelosi just continue or

43
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:50,640
average too

44
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,440
peach present dollars i drop a second

45
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,720
time a second impeachment only days before

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,750
president trump believe office is as unnecessary

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,940
as it is inflammatory they're saying for

48
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,100
the sake of unity forgo impeachment

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,400
well you know i think there's a

50
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800
couple of things one is we have

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,380
to understand that what happened on wednesday

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,340
with insurrection against the united states that

53
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,310
is what that is what donald trump

54
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,960
engaged in and that is what those

55
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,442
has formed a capital engaged in and

56
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,220
so when we talk about healing the

57
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,430
prom

58
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:25,980
the feeling is set for it and

59
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,490
in fact requires accountability and so if

60
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,490
we allow insurrection against the united states

61
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,120
with impunity with no accountability we are

62
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,569
inviting it to happen again that is

63
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:40,830
how serious it is and i do

64
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:43,488
not believe that that perhaps my

65
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,840
colleagues weren't in that room perhaps my

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,411
colleagues were not fully present for the

67
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:52,440
events on wednesday but half of which

68
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,150
came close to half of the house

69
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,420
nearly dying on wednesday and

70
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,450
if a foreign head of state if

71
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,490
another head of state came in and

72
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,010
ordered an attack on the united states

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,130
congress would we say that that should

74
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,530
not be prosecuted should we would we

75
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,180
say that there should be absolutely no

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,300
response to that no it is an

77
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,280
act of insurrection it's an act of

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,659
hostility and we

79
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,880
must have accountability because without it it

80
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,200
will happen again

81
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,140
there's a concern also from democrats though

82
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,549
that if you're having a senate charlie

83
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,710
can happen in the next ten days

84
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,840
reading the senator only early days of

85
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,820
president vitamins term it's going to prevent

86
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,280
the confirmation of his appointees to the

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,959
cabin and it's going to slow down

88
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,449
for half the passage of essential coven

89
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:40,560
relief legislation

90
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,190
you know i think i'm you know

91
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,297
george i think we need to review

92
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:48,030
what actually happened on wednesday the national

93
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,030
guard was requested by the dc council

94
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,759
and was rejected we are talking about

95
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,740
and we are hearing about a complete

96
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,050
and utter lack of preparation the chief

97
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,712
of the dc capitol police lied to

98
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:01,919
have

99
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,554
ministration chairwoman so lofgren about the preparations

100
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,860
of what happened we need to know

101
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,830
what happened and how deep this goes

102
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,710
and if we do not and if

103
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,630
we do not take corrective action right

104
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,850
now we are talking about those same

105
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:21,000
potentially compromised alison elements being in charge

106
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,065
of the presidency

107
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,809
already during the inauguration and so you

108
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:27,450
know with with profound respect i'm i

109
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,700
i believe that the president's safety and

110
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,324
the safety of the united states congress

111
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:33,420
and and the security of our country

112
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,050
it takes precedence over the timing of

113
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,020
nominations and the timing of a potential

114
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,132
confirmations it in a

115
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:45,811
media danger right now fear confident house

116
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,496
speaker miss was going to move forward

117
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:47,970
to page one

118
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:51,120
know i i do believe that we

119
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,130
will be moving forward with impeachment but

120
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,048
again we are working towards a multiple

121
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,400
avenues and i don't i do not

122
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,620
believe that those avenues are mutually exclusive

123
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,810
this is not an either or proposition

124
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,640
this is not either the twenty fifth

125
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,808
amendment or impeachment or you know it

126
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:08,490
it i'm you know investigating are other

127
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,330
avenues to

128
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,160
or the fourteenth amendment neither i do

129
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,660
not believe that any of these avenues

130
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,240
are competitive with one another they all

131
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,520
out and they all frankly provide their

132
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,970
own form of of relief and they're

133
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,430
only own forms of accountability and so

134
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,290
i do not believe that this is

135
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,140
a question of deciding or debating between

136
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,479
which of these avenues which should

137
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,840
pursue i believe we should take an

138
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:33,180
all of the above approach carson thanks
