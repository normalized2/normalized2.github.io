1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,450
first of all i'm wishing say this

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,920
there is a death toll which now

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,159
stands at five we should note that

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,900
is one greater than the number of

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,569
americans who died in the attack on

6
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:22,890
the u s government buildings and mean

7
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:24,330
guys e over eight years ago

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,700
last time an american government building was

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,960
overrun by rampaging and violent mob that

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,430
led to more than two years of

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,940
investigations dozens of congressional hearing

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,520
for the people who were killed as

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,753
a result of the capitol attack appeared

14
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:43,410
to have been rioters themselves one of

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,640
whom was shot in the neck by

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
police as she and others attempted to

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,110
break into the speaker's lobby just outside

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,819
the house chamber as you can see

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,789
in this video the most recent casualty

20
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,769
of the mob that the president and

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,120
other republicans in sight

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,240
added it's capitol police officer brian sick

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,040
nick he's a forty two year old

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,190
veteran according to reporting are sick neck

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,249
was struck with a fire extinguisher amidst

26
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:11,100
the chaos on wednesday he succumbed to

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,668
his injuries last night and that means

28
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:16,738
the us capital is now the site

29
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:17,280
of a hummus

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,080
side investigation among other things

31
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:21,780
well we saw it happen on wednesday

32
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:24,000
was the apparent murder of a police

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
officer by members of a mob incited

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,009
and directed the capital by the president

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,590
of the united states who hoped they

36
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,640
wouldn't successfully intimidate members of congress out

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,669
of certifying the rightful democratic victory of

38
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:39,840
his political opponent

39
00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:43,860
we all watched this terrible spectacle unfold

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,820
live on tv

41
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,390
the images broadcast were largely not the

42
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,580
most horrifying ones of the day much

43
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,060
of what we saw silly costumes people

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,190
taking cell fees and grabbing the speakers

45
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,740
lectern looked kind of like a group

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,300
that might even attend the trump boat

47
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,810
parade

48
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,800
but there was something way way darker

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,340
more violent more sinister and more organized

50
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,560
happening in that capital on wednesday and

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,790
it's time we see it clearly

52
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,700
it's crowds were gathering on the east

53
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,750
side of the capitol in the early

54
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,699
afternoon you'll remember the republican center josh

55
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,348
holly missouri walked by giving any support

56
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,530
of fist bump on his way in

57
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,959
to object to the electoral college results

58
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,590
to vote against pennsylvania feeding their electors

59
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,700
who voted for joe biden

60
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,250
and after the rioters broke and we

61
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,050
got i witness accounts of people marauding

62
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,270
through capitol hill looking for the vice

63
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,789
president for reuters' editor saying he heard

64
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,310
at least three different rioters at the

65
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,770
capitol say they hope to find vice

66
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,621
president mike pence and execute him by

67
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:49,080
hanging him from the capitol hill free

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,010
as a crater

69
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,939
indeed one of the insurrection is erected

70
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,830
a gallows for the news spread outside

71
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,310
the capital

72
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,830
this is a video of a crowd

73
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,170
chanting hang on my pets

74
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,660
both pence the vice president was in

75
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,520
the capital had to be taken to

76
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,130
a secure location because he hadn't failed

77
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,960
to do the thing that donald trump

78
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,240
told that crowd of people that mob

79
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:14,487
that my pence had to do or

80
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:17,130
face consequences or face their wrath

81
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,189
here's some more footage this is of

82
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:22,408
an eight p photographer being attacked as

83
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,120
he covered the riots he gets shoved

84
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,830
around the crowd as it descends on

85
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,730
him eventually

86
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,580
he's pulled to safety by cooler headed

87
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,070
trump supporter luckily for lord knows what

88
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,880
would have happened to them

89
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,790
we're also hearing first hand accounts of

90
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,170
the terror from other members of the

91
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,420
press aaron chef staff photographer the new

92
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,560
york times writes that she was in

93
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,600
the capitol rotunda when suddenly two or

94
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,610
three men in black surrounded me and

95
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,110
demanded to know who i work for

96
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,401
grabbing my press pass they saw them

97
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:50,040
my id said the new york times

98
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,930
and became really angry they threw me

99
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,310
to the floor trying to take my

100
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:53,880
cameras

101
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,700
started screaming for help as loudly as

102
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,339
i could don't want to taint people

103
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,830
just walk this point i thought i

104
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,420
could be killed and no one would

105
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,990
stop them

106
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,239
rip one of my cameras away from

107
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,499
the broken lens on the other and

108
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:08,160
ran away

109
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,390
and then there are the deeply unsettling

110
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,270
images of this guy in the senate

111
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,930
chamber dressed in full tactical gear carrying

112
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,430
plastic zip tie

113
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,939
as damned cause writes for slate those

114
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,070
are actually flex cuffs the plastic double

115
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,710
restrains often used by police in mass

116
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,700
arrests situation

117
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,026
they went into the capital as congress

118
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,640
was counted electoral votes equipped to take

119
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,723
hostages' to physically seize officials and presume

120
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:40,890
living to take lot

121
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,260
it is entirely possible that there were

122
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,650
people in that crowd looking to apprehend

123
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,610
and possibly harm and possibly murder the

124
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,340
leaders of the political class that the

125
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,889
president and people like mo brooks and

126
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:00,390
even to a certain extent ted cruz

127
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,190
and josh hawley have told them

128
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,300
have the trade them

129
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,210
and if you don't believe me listen

130
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,080
to them in their own words i

131
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,910
have to warn you this video which

132
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,950
was licensed from a self described civil

133
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,780
rights activist is disturbing

134
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:20,798
many people are going to put it

135
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:21,090
that way

136
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,350
i got hurt

137
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,239
don't want to

138
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:29,850
we will make them had that

139
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,050
yeah

140
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:36,090
yeah

141
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,080
another extremely extremely disturbing video shows a

142
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,730
crowd of trump's supporters trying to force

143
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,560
their way in as officers including one

144
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,899
who is in serious distress or to

145
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:31,560
hold their ground

146
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:38,188
death toll from one wednesday's rampage stands

147
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:41,460
at five leaves offer was killed now

148
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:44,670
an active homicide investigation to murdered him

149
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,889
with the accomplices might be an number

150
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:50,220
scale of evil that might have been

151
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,620
done the skill death and destruction that

152
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,840
might have been visited is almost impossible

153
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,620
to comprehend

154
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,470
what would have happened if they hadn't

155
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,330
gotten to nancy pelosi or chuck schumer

156
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,800
mike pence you thing

157
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,280
and this was unleashed by the president

158
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,779
and no uncertain terms let's go back

159
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,970
on december nineteenth down trump tweeted big

160
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:11,490
protest in dc on january six be

161
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,980
there we'll be wild

162
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,070
speakers at that protest on wednesday riled

163
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,537
up the crowd rudy giuliani called on

164
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:20,310
them to settle the election by a

165
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,090
trial by combat republican congressman mo brooks

166
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,560
of alabama said it was time to

167
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,170
start quote taking down names and kicking

168
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,660
ass and then donald trump spoke to

169
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,190
his supporters and lead it all on

170
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:32,670
the table

171
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:35,940
we're going to have to fight much

172
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,420
harder

173
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:39,030
and my fish just gonna have to

174
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,710
come through for us and if he

175
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,010
does

176
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,190
that will be a sad day for

177
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,620
our country forgot to walk down to

178
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,520
the capital

179
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:53,610
we got to our brave

180
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,450
senators and congressmen and women and we're

181
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,340
probably not going to be cheering so

182
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,320
much for some of them

183
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,390
because you'll never take back our country

184
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,950
with a weak this you have to

185
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,481
show strength and you have to be

186
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:10,019
strong

187
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,054
you hear that threat to mike pence

188
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,190
he's going to have to come through

189
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,490
for us

190
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,680

195
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,490

197
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,295
republican senator ben sasse or of a

198
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,119
brass can report that trump was delighted

199
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,160
by the chaos as it unfolded at

200
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,871
the capitol and the washington post reports

201
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:39,120

202
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,770
the national guard being sent in to

203
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,280

he must face legal consequences for those

00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,620
actions

210
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,830
even though very few people were arrested

211
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,060

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,950

215
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,407

219
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,820
capital

220
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,255

230
00:10:38,564 --> 00:10:40,245
the capitol police on what the hell

232
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,775
was hospitalized and how

233
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,955
everyone is piecing this together from reporting

234
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,005
and video and it is hard to

235
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:50,145
